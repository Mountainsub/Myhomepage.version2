- <b>Algebraic Geometry</b> is <font color="#ff0099"><b>surface by equation</b></font><br>
<br>
Abstract
I major in Algebraic Geometry. My research object is mathematical surface by Algebraic equation. <br>
I am inclined on "algebraic" equation ,not differential equation.
<br>
My research is applied to information technology, in particular, protocol technology.
<br>
Action(meaned by mathematics) is automorphism.(translating elements into another elements in the set.) For instance, "f" is action and "a" is an element. To "fa" , Decryption is possible. (Decryption is the translation into the original.) "1/f" times, it is back to the original.
Suppose no dividing.(units are identity and -1　× identity only.) Two times maps is not back to the original.
Of clockwise rotating action, 1/3 rotate action. The translation two-times acts it. <br>
This comes the original. My first research step is n-times-back-to-the-original(identity). "n" is called the order. More and more difficult action is function. And actions which have the different order. Number sets or function sets, divided equivalence to cosets. And then, between actions ,there is no dividing.
For "coset of function set", roughly the original function set is linked to the equation(s). These tool is called Jacobi variety.
<br>
<br>
Divisor is mathematical tool. In these cosets, divisor is important. Divisor has the calculating property. Action has the divisor. Surface is by three-variables. Take divisor on surface. More and more complex it is.... the divisor about singilar point. The divisor is meant by irreducible components. For this, it needs desingularization. My research focus on desingularization.
By invarients, surface is classified. Genus g is used in classification. In g=1,g=2, I focus on desingularization , expression,then classification.
